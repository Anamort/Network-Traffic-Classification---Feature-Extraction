# Network-Traffic-Classification---Feature-Extraction

This was important module for my project namely Network Traffic Classification in 2015 when I was an undergraduate student. This program takes pcap files as an input in recursive manner and extract important features for each flow. Afterwardsi these feature values can be used to measure the performance of classification algorithms including Bayes Net, J48, k-NN etc.
